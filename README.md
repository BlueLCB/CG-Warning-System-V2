# CG-Warning-System-V2

**Coruscant Guard MDT**
A lightweight tool to track and manage infractions for Coruscant Guard members using a modern Python interface.

**How to Install and Run**
âœ… Requirements
- Python 3.9 or newer
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No additional libraries needed (uses built-in tkinter and sqlite3)

ðŸ“¥ Installation Steps
- Download Python (if you don't have it yet):
https://www.python.org/downloads

Download this program:
- Click the green Code button on GitHub, then choose Download ZIP
- Extract the ZIP file to any folder on your computer

Run the application:
- Double-click the mdt.py file
OR
- Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder and run:
  python mdt.py

How It Works
- All warnings are saved in a local file called warnings.db (created automatically).
- You can add warnings, view them in a table, and clear them by username.
- The dropdown contains all infraction codes with full descriptions.
- The warning view area shows a short description (like "Refusal to post").

**âš¡ Option 2: Run with the .exe File (No Python Needed)**
If you don't want to install Python or deal with code, use the pre-built .exe file:
- Go to the Releases section on this GitHub page.
- Download the latest .exe file:
*CoruscantGuardMDT.exe*
- (Optional) Also download warnings.db if you want to use a shared or backup database.

Run the app:
- Just double-click the .exe file.
- It will open the program instantly â€” no install required.

âœ… All warnings will be saved in the same folder as the .exe using a local database file (warnings.db).
